# Conway-s-Game-of-Life

Made using Python's standard library. 

For the Glider Animation and Garden of Eden, the width and height are preset.

For the Conway's Game of Life : input the width in first and press ENTER and next type in the height and press ENTER.

The width and height must be atleast 1 and do not have to be necessarily equal to each other. 

After this the type of input is asked. If you type A and press ENTER, an automatically generated random grid will be generated. 

If you type M and press ENTER. You will have to type in each of the cells in the grid (1 or 0) and press ENTER for each. You will have to provide that many inputs as many cells are there, which is width * height.
